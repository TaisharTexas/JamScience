## Notes:
The initial data file (flight_data_2018_2024.csv) is too large to store in git so you'll need to download it manually and drop it into your local project. Both the raw data file and the parsed version of the file that is generated by the code (cleaned_flight_data.csv) are in the .gitignore so they wont sync when you add them to your project
